#dcgreatrex articles

This is the source of my articles blog. It is built using the Pelican platform in Python.
Requirements

Recent version of IPython. The liquid_tags plugin above requires IPython 1.0. Note that previously this could be built with the stand-alone nbconvert package. That no longer works with the recent liquid_tags plugin.

Recent version of Pelican. For the static paths (downloads, images, figures, etc.) to appear in the right place, Pelican 3.3+ must be used.
